# userlogin

A website where users are given options to register and login.

If a username or email is already present in the database then the user registration will not be successful.

And if they are unique and are different, then the user registration will be successful.

After registering, the user will be directed to the home page where the user's name is shown and a welcome message will be displayed along with the logout option.

If the username and password are entered correctly only then the user will be logged into the website.

If either one is entered wrong then the user will not be logged into the website.
